v.1.0	Sat May  3 13:28:27 CEST 2008
	- %s in format string wasn't robust on some platforms. The availability check
	  was removed and everything dumbed down as kindly suggested by one user.
	- Used the opportunity for making this a major release.

v.1.0.1 Sat May  3 14:05:56 CEST 2008
	- Fixed POD wording.

v.1.1   Thu Aug 27 20:02:32 CEST 2009
	- Fixed Tag der deutschen Einheit for pre-1990 (June 17 then). This has 
	  been my peeve for far too long. ;-)
	- Compatibility tested: 5.6.1-5.10.1
	- Reverted example scripts to plain ASCII.

v1.2    Sun Nov  8 08:22:34 CET 2009

v1.3    Sat Apr 17 18:34:33 2010 +0200
        - Added Augsburg Peace Day as optional local holiday.
	  Requested and patch kindly provided by Marc Andr√© Selig.

v1.4    Sun Aug 15 13:12:47 CEST 2010
	- Oliver Paukstadt added religious "silent days" 
	  - Ash wednesday
	  - Maundy Thursday
	  - Holy Saturday
	  - Remembrance Day, German Style
	  - Sunday in commemoration of the dead
	  - 4 Sundays of Advent

v1.5	Mon Mar 21 11:10:47 CET 2011
	- Tobias Leich fixed:
	  - Sloppy whitespaces and indentation
	  - Status of Easter Sunday and Whit Sunday as official holidays
	    only in one state.
	  - State code for Berlin. Code differed from documentation and there
	    is limited use for the empty Berlin holiday set anyway, so we 
	    assume that this slight interface change won't break anything.
